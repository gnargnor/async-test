# I want to go fast.

Python has become my language of choice, but many of the popular frameworks do not support async yet.  After learning 
development using Node and Express, this is unacceptable.  My goal is to explore the async frameworks in order
to make use of them in my Python development.

## Getting started

* Clone the repo
* `> python3 -m venv venv`
* `> source venv/bin/activate`
* `> pip install -r requirements.txt`
* `> python3 server.py`
